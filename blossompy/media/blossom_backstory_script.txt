Hi! My name is Blossom, very nice to meet you!

I don't know about you, but sometimes I feel unhappy and frustrated. This can be really annoying right?

If you also sometimes feel the same way. My friend Joanna recommended a really useful trick to help us feel better whenever we are having negative or bad feelings again.
It is called "mindfulness breathing exercise". Would you want to give a try?
